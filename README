NAME
    CPAN::Test::Dummy::Perl5::Make::FailConfigRequires - CPAN Test Dummy

VERSION
    This documentation refers to version 1.00.

SYNOPSIS
        use CPAN::Test::Dummy::Perl5::Make::FailLate;

DESCRIPTION
    This module has been developed with the single purpose of testing
    CPAN.pm itself.

    Contains no functionality, and will never do so. On the contrary, it
    dies during Makefile.PL due to an impossible configure_requires in
    META.yml.

AUTHOR
    David A. Golden, based on CPAN::Test::Dummy::Perl5::Make::Failearly by
    Andreas Koenig.
